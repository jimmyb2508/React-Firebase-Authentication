# Code Along - React & Firebase Authentication

This is a code along I have pushed with the purpose of helping fellow dev's looking to learn about authentication for the first time.

The application utilizes the authentication suite offered by Firebase so no server-side code is necessary. 

The React app utilizes the latest Hooks.

Finally, the REACT_APP .env.development is utilized to ensure API keys aren't stored in the code.

## Prerequisites

You are going to need to install node.js & jest in order to run this application.

* Firebase - Install Here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase
* React - Install Here: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html
* dotenv - Install Here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv
